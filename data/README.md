# FlightPhase Data Directory

This directory is used to store data files for the FlightPhase application.

## Contents

- `inquiries.json`: Contains all submitted inquiries from the website.

## Purpose

This directory and its files serve as a simple file-based storage solution. In a production environment, you would typically replace this with a proper database solution like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or similar.

## Note

This README file is committed to the repository to ensure the `data` directory is created, but the actual data files (*.json) should be ignored by git.
